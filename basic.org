# what is cookie?

Cookies are small bits of information that stateless protocols like HTTP use to maintain some persistent information across requests.


I [saw](https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework/blob/9c3e7a7f9389a5c2b6d6a10125833f88cbcf3577/core/browser.py#L24) you using '[QNetworkCookie](https://wiki.qt.io/About_Qt)'


It seems to me, this package might track some information across requests.

This is volidate the fundamental notation?

Please comment anything you have and make suggestions.

The security issue to all casduer is the most important thing.


# 我们可以做什么
please encrypt your sensitive information before uploading them to the cloud use some end-2-end encrypted message application

For non-expert users, usability is very important. Try:

- Olvid / Signal for encrypted message (I prefer the first one)
- Keybase for both message and encrypted storage (like git)

For experts, you can try:

- git crypt: https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/
- GPG tools
